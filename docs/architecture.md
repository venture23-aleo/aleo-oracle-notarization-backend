# Architecture & Working Flow

## Notarization Backend Working Flow

### 1. Initialization
- When the backend starts, it generates an Aleo public-private key pair.
- This key is subsequently used to sign the complete attestation report after it has been serialized and encoded in an Aleo-specific format.

### 2. Attestation Request
- A user submits an attestation request to the backend.
- The backend performs the following steps:
  - Checks whether the target URL is included in the whitelist.
  - Validates the format of the attestation request payload.
  - If the request is valid, it fetches the data that needs to be attested.

### 3. Oracle Proof Data Preparation
- The backend constructs the oracle report data, which includes:
  - Details of the attestation request,
  - A timestamp,
  - The attestation data itself.

### 4. Hashing and Encoding
- **Encoded Request:**  
  To generate the encoded request, the attestation data and timestamp fields in the report data are temporarily set to zero. This standardizes the report data for hashing, ensuring the hash does not include the actual attestation data or timestamp.
- **Request Hash:**  
  A Poseidon8 hash is computed from the encoded request, producing a unique identifier for the request parameters (excluding attestation data and timestamp).
- **Timestamped Request Hash:**  
  The request hash is combined with the actual timestamp, and this combination is hashed again using Poseidon8. This step binds the request to a specific point in time.
- **Attestation Hash:**  
  The complete report data, now including the real attestation data and timestamp, is hashed using Poseidon8. The resulting attestation hash is embedded within the SGX quote to prove the integrity and origin of the attested data.

### 5. Quote Generation
- **Quoting Enclave (QE):**  
  Generates a quote, which is a signed statement containing enclave details, the attestation hash, a signature created with the PCK private key, and the PCK certification chain.
- **Provisioning Enclave (PE):**  
  Assists in provisioning cryptographic keys during the initialization of the QE.

### 6. Final Signing and Output
- The oracle report is generated from the quote.
- A Poseidon8 hash of the oracle report is signed using the Aleo private key.
- The backend sends:
  - The attestation report to the remote verifier backend.
  - The oracle data to the Aleo oracle program.

### 7. Verification
- The verifier backend and the Aleo program check that:
  - The quote originates from a genuine enclave.
  - The data is correctly signed and has not been tampered with.

## DCAP based Remote Attestation Flow

The DCAP attestation flow is as follows:

## Contents of a SGX Quote (at a high level)

### 1. **Report Body (from the Application Enclave)**
This is the core enclave information, created by the target (application) enclave, and includes:

| Field	    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
|MRENCLAVE	|Measurement (SHA256 hash) of the enclave code and initial state.
|MRSIGNER	|Measurement of the entity that signed the enclave.
|ISV_SVN	    |Enclave's version number (Security Version Number).
|ATTRIBUTES	|Enclave configuration flags (e.g., debug, 64-bit, etc.).
|REPORTDATA	|64-byte field optionally filled by the enclave (e.g., to hash app-specific input or nonce).

### 2. **Quote Header**
Metadata about how the quote was created.

| Field	| Description|
| --------- | ----------- |
| Version	|Quote format version.
| Attestation Key Type	|Usually EPID (older) or ECDSA (modern).
| QE SVN	|Quoting Enclave Security Version Number.
| QE Vendor ID	|Intel vendor ID.
| User Data	|Optional app-specific data.

### 3. **Signature and Authentication**
Used to authenticate the quote to the verifier.

| Field	| Description|
| --------- | ----------- |
| Signature	|Signature over the report using the PCK private key.
| Auth Data	|Authenticated data (e.g., signature structure).
| PCK Certificate Chain	|Public cert chain starting from the PCK cert up to Intel's root CA.

### 4. **QE Report + QE Report Signature**
To prove that the Quoting Enclave itself is trustworthy.

| Field	| Description|
| --------- | ----------- |
| QE Report	|A report generated by the QE about itself.
| QE Report Signature	|Signed by the platform's quoting infrastructure (used by the verifier to validate the QE).

## Gramine Framework

This project uses the [Gramine Framework](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run the notarization backend inside an Intel SGX enclave. Gramine is a lightweight guest OS designed to run a single Linux application with minimal host requirements, providing:

- **SGX compatibility:** Seamless execution of unmodified Linux applications inside Intel SGX enclaves.
- **Security:** Additional protection against side-channel attacks and strong isolation from the host and container environment.
- **Manifest-based configuration:** Fine-grained control over file system access, environment variables, and resource limits.
- **File system isolation:** Ability to provide static `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf` to the enclave, ensuring deterministic and secure runtime behavior.

**Note:**  
You do not need to install Gramine on your host unless you want to generate the enclave signing key using `gramine-sgx-gen-private-key` or run/debug Gramine applications outside Docker. All necessary Gramine tools and runtime are included in the Docker image.

For more details, see the [Gramine Documentation](https://gramine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
