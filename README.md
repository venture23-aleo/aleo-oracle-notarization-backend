# Aleo Oracle Notarization Backend

## Overview

The Aleo Oracle Notarization Backend is a secure service that acts as a data oracle, running inside an Intel SGX enclave. The enclave is uniquely identified by a fingerprint called **MRENCLAVE**, which proves the code and configuration running inside. This backend fetches external data (such as cryptocurrency prices), processes it securely within the enclave, and generates a signed attestation report. This report contains both the unique enclave ID and the fetched oracle data, and can be verified by other systems‚Äîeither by a separate backend or directly on-chain in an Aleo Oracle smart contract‚Äîto ensure the data is authentic and was produced by a trusted enclave.

The backend can handle different types of data, including integers, floats, and strings. Every time the backend restarts, the enclave automatically creates a new public-private key pair. The Aleo oracle contract keeps track of the current public key, so it can verify signatures from the enclave. This design guarantees that the oracle data is both trustworthy (integrity) and up-to-date (freshness), supporting decentralized and trust-minimized applications.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** (with BuildKit enabled)
- **Intel SGX hardware** (with DCAP support and drivers installed)
- **Access to the SGX device files** (`/dev/sgx/enclave`, `/dev/sgx/provision`)

### Basic Setup
```sh
# Generate enclave signing key
make generate-enclave-signing-key

# Build and run the application
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

### Common Commands
```sh
make build         # Build Go binary
make test          # Run tests
make docker-run    # Build and run with Docker
make help          # Show all available commands
```

## üîß Configuration

The application contains config.json `internal/configs/config.json` files with default values. Overriding the default values will change the enclave measurement hash (MRENCLAVE).

- **PORT** - The port for the application.
- **WHITELISTED_DOMAINS** - The domains that are whitelisted for the attestation.
- **METRICS_PORT** - The port for the metrics server.
- **PRICE_FEED_CONFIG** - The configuration for the price feed.
- **LOG_LEVEL** - The level of logging for the application.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

This application runs inside an Intel SGX enclave for enhanced security. The enclave provides:

- **Code integrity** - Ensures the application code hasn't been tampered with
- **Data confidentiality** - Protects sensitive data from the host system
- **Attestation** - Proves the application is running in a genuine enclave

## üîÑ Reproducibility

To reproduce the enclave measurement hash (MRENCLAVE), you can run the following commands:

```sh
make generate-enclave-signing-key
make extract-enclave-artifacts
``` 

It will generate/update a `enclave_artifacts` directory in the root of the project. You can use this directory to verify the enclave measurement hash (MRENCLAVE) of the running enclave. Ensure that the Intel SGX driver is loaded and the device files `sgx_enclave` and `sgx_provision` are accessible.
